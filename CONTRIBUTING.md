## I have only a question!

We encourage people from opening an issue to ask a question or report a bug.

## What should I know before I get started?

### AlphaPart package

AlphaPart is an open-source project. When you initially consider contributing to AlphaPart, you might be sure about using the AlphaGenes/AlphaPart repository to implement the functionality you want to change or report a bug. This section should help you with that.

AlphaPart has intentionally coded using standard `R` to build the base idea and `C++` using the `Rcpp` package to speed up the analysis.  `R` code can be founded in the usual `R` folder while `C++` is in the `scr` folder.

### Design Decisions

When we make a significant decision in upgrading the package version, we will document it in the [News file](NEWS.md). If you question how we have been updating the package and fixed bugs, check to see if it is reported there. If it is *not* documented there, please open a new issue on [AlphaGenes/AlphaPart](https://github.com/AlphaGenes/AlphaPart/issues) and ask your question.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for AlphaPart. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your message, reproduce the reported behaviour, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports at [AlphaGenes/AlphaPart](https://github.com/AlphaGenes/AlphaPart/issues), please check if someone already did the same report. Thus you don't need to make another one. When you create a bug report, please include as many details as possible to resolve issues faster.

**Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How to submit a (good) bug report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). We expected you to explain the problem and include additional information to help maintainers reproduce the problem. 

* **Use a clear and informative title** for the issue to identify the problem you are experiencing.

* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. In this case, you can use a tiny dataset as an example to demonstrate the steps.

* If applicable, please, **explain which behaviour you expected to see instead and why you expected that.**

* **If the problem is related to package performance or computer memory**, include a CPU and Memory profile with your report.  You may want to start by looking into `top` or `htop` to see the processes overview in the Unix operating system (Linux and MAC). On the other hand, you can open the Performance Analyzer log for the Windows system and try to understand why the issue is occurring.

### Pull Requests

What we are looking for when accepting a pull request:

- Maintain AlphaPart quality
- Fix problems that are important to end-users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible AlphaPart

More details on the Pull Request will be described soon.
